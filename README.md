# Sentiment-Analysis
A collaborative machine learning project by Harsha Vardhan, Hari Charan and Rishith
This project explores how machines can understand and classify human emotions expressed in text—such as tweets, reviews, or comments—into categories like positive, negative, or neutral.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization
Sentiment Classification: Implemented models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and/or LSTM
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Visualization: Sentiment distribution and confusion matrix for model comparison

Technologies Used:
Languages: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, NLTK / spaCy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
(Optional) TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning 
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / Streamlit
